multiplex.m converts binary_targets into 6 different arrays for the respective emotions. So before choose_best_decision_matrix and decision tree functions are being called, `multiplex(binary_targets)` will be called first to allow for the conversion of targets into binary format. 

As of now, `choose_best_decision_matrix` has been mostly done, though the implementation could be checked through. the structure for decision tree isn't ready yet, and neither is the `decision_tree_learning` function completed.
